== Scope
The goal of this guide is to describe the onboarding process that a team
needs to perform to onboard a product in
HACBS (Hybrid Application Console Build Services).
After completing all the steps described in this guide, a product team:

* Has an environment prepared to build a product
* Has at least a single component of the product defined
* Is able to build the defined component

This guide guides you through the initial configuration for a product;
the product definition can be expanded later by adding additional
configuration information.
